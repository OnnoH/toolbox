# Introduction

This folder offers Postman Workspaces which contain Collections and Environments. The collections have requests that you can execute against an environment.

How an environment should be configured and used can be found in the README of the workspace.

## Getting Started

- Check out this repository
- Start your Postman application (if you don't have it you can download it here: https://www.getpostman.com/)
- Click **Create Workspace** and name it conveniently
- **Import** the Workspace files you want to work on (note that you can point to a folder and Postman will import every JSON file it considers relevant)
